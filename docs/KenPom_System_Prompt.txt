# Explore the codebase to understand its structure
- Explore the codebase systematically to understand its structure and identify opportunities for cleanup.
- Identify outdated scripts and markdown files that can be removed
- Consider merging documents to keep things tidy
- Improve management of temp files from tests or session summaries
- Ensure files get stored in clear, organized directory locations

<methods>
Let me start by exploring the project structure to understand what we're working with.
- Analyze the API structure for captured data to understand how to build a direct API client
- build a direct API client API with browser session cookies for websites found to have well structured API and if not:
	- revert to DOM scraping
	- use the page text which is more reliable
	- add a more targeted JavaScript extraction based on the actual HTML structure visible in the screenshots
</methods>

# Use Case 
## Benefit
- Closing Line Value (CLV)
	- Gold standard - beating the closing line consistently = profitable
- Model Calibration
	- Compare your predictions to market consensus
- Line Movement Analysis
	- Track how sharp money moves lines
- Backtesting
	- Test strategies on historical data before betting
- Market Efficiency
	- Find where Vegas is consistently off (conferences, situations)
- Feature Engineering
	- Use opening/closing line diff as ML feature

## Database Design
<purpose>
- Create a performance analytics script that generates reports from the historical database.
- SQLite database for storing odds, results, predictions
- Fetch final scores from ESPN and update database
- Generate performance analytics and reports
- Strategic plan for model improvement
- Complete the database schema and integration
- Create a script to scrape and store results
- Outline a roadmap for model improvement using historical data
- Suggest specific analytics and features
- Confirmation this is an excellent approach
- Complete the database integration with the scraper
- Create a results scraper/updater
- Outline analytics opportunities
- Suggest ML/statistical improvements
</purpose>

# Running the Overtime Scraper
- update the main script to handle the case when no games are found more gracefully, with a helpful message about why and when to try again.
PowerShell   
```uv run python scrape_overtime_lines.py```
## Initialize the database:
PowerShell   
```uv run python -c "from kenp0m_sp0rts_analyzer.historical_odds_db import get_db; get_db()"```
## After games complete, update results:
PowerShell   
```uv run python scrape_results.py```
## View analytics:
PowerShell   
```uv run python analyze_performance.py```

<goals>
Provide the data infrastructure to continuously improve predictions based on empirical results rather than assumptions. After ~100 games, obtain enough data for meaningful statistical analysis!
</goals>
<features>
- Graceful empty state handling where no games are available:
	- Shows a helpful explanation of why
	- Provides tips on when to try again
	- Saves an empty snapshot file (useful for tracking)
	- Returns success (exit code 0) - it's not an error
## Tonight (games completed/in progress) - will show helpful message
```uv run python scrape_overtime_lines.py```
## Tomorrow's lines (usually available late evening)
```uv run python scrape_overtime_lines.py --tomorrow```
## Opening lines (run in morning)
```uv run python scrape_overtime_lines.py --tomorrow --open```
## Closing lines (run ~30 min before first game)
```uv run python scrape_overtime_lines.py --close```
